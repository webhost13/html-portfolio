<h3> AVENGERS THE END GAME</h3>
<p> Endgame is a terrific example of that epic intimacy that Marvel does so well - alternating between glorious action and subtle character moments. Watching it almost feels like taking a wistful walk down memory lane, flanked on either side by a Russo brother, our hands held firmly in theirs.</p>
<h3>
    INTERSTELLAR
</h3>
<P>
    Interstellar is a visual masterpiece that has a human touch that propels it to greatness. It is perhaps one of the best space movies ever made. Christopher Nolan isn't one known to be taciturn when it comes to his movies. Even his smaller movies like Momento have grand structures bolstering their simple plots.

<h3>JERSEY</h3>
<p>
    This is an emotional film which portrays a person who is struggling to make it big in life at a later stage in his life. This film motivates us with a strong message that it's never too late to achieve as long as there's hardwork and dedication.
